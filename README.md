## Risks and Mitigation

- Risk 1: Lack of Android development experience

  - Desc.: May lead to trying to build functions that we're not ready for
  - Mitigation: Keeping diligent with our studies and reading up on outside resources

- Risk 2: Potential withdrawal from course from any of the team members

  - Desc.: Unforseen events causing anyone to not be able to participate in the group project
  - Mitigation: Still will have another team member remaining due to 3-person group

- Risk 3: Time management of teammates working together or individually
  - Desc.: There could be conflicts in schedules which may prevent teammates from meeting and discussing the project together
  - Mitigation: Planning ahead and keeping up communication in the discord server
